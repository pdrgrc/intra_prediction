# intra_prediction
HEVC intra prediction based on impainting algorithm
Here is a HEVC intra prediction like tools based on numpy packages accelerated in PyOpenCL.
Linear solver part is accelerate based on lossless and lossy encoding methods. Other parts unfinished.
Another data transfer structure needed to be applied to this to overcome the bottleneck.
